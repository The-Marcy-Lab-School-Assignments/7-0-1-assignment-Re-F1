# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

Dependency arrays is an array of values that the effect depends on. An array with a variable in it will only trigger when that variable is changing or has changed. If there is no dependency array then this will trigger and is called on every state of change.

Good start, but your answer is missing key details. Be sure to explain all three ways to provide a dependency array in useEffect: with an empty array [], with specific dependencies [someDependency], and with no array at all (i.e., undefined)
