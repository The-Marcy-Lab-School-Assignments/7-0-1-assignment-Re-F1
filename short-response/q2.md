# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer
Dependency arrays is an array of values that the effect depends on. An array with a variable in it will only trigger when that variable is changing or has changed. If there is no dependency array then this will trigger and is called on every state of change.

`Empty Dependency` :
This will run once after the component shows up
```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('I will run only once');
}, []);
```
The reason why this will only run once is because the dependency array is empty, therefore nothing in the array could possibly be changed


`Specific Dependency`
This will only be executed after anything is changed in
```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('hello world');
}, [someState, someProp]);
```

`No Dependency Array`
Do this every single time after every change:
```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('hello world');
});

```
